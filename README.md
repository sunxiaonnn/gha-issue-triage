AI-powered issue triage GitHub Action. Detects duplicates, scores relevance,
analyzes feasibility, auto-labels, and posts a sticky summary comment with the
analysis (edited in place on re-runs).

## What it does

1. **Duplicate Detection** — Fuzzy matches new issues against existing ones using `difflib.SequenceMatcher`
2. **Relevance Scoring** — LLM-based scoring against repo scope (README.md, CLAUDE.md)
3. **Feasibility Analysis** — Two orthogonal judgements per issue:
   - `feasibility` (`yes` / `no`) — *can* this be built at all? (`no` means out-of-physics / out-of-scope of software, e.g. "build a faster-than-light drive".)
   - `complexity` (`low` / `medium` / `high`) — *if* feasible, how hard? Drives `good-first-issue` when `low`.
4. **Auto-Labeling** — Applies labels: `duplicate`, `bug`, `feature`, `enhancement`, `good-first-issue`, `needs-discussion`, `invalid`
5. **Sticky Summary Comment** — Posts a single bot comment with the analysis (relevance, feasibility, duplicate match). Re-runs edit the same comment instead of stacking new ones.

## Inputs

| Name | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GH_TOKEN` | Yes | — | GitHub token for gh CLI |
| `AI_TOKEN` | No | `github.token` | GitHub Models API token. Default works as long as the caller workflow declares `permissions: models: read`. See [`docs/integrations.md`](docs/integrations.md) for PAT alternatives. |
| `MODEL` | No | `openai/gpt-4.1` | LLM model |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | No | — | Anthropic API key (alternative backend) |
| `OPENAI_API_BASE` | No | — | Base URL of an OpenAI-compatible endpoint (Mistral/Ollama/vLLM); takes precedence when set |
| `MAX_DUPLICATES` | No | `10` | Max duplicate candidates |
| `SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD` | No | `0.6` | Fuzzy match threshold (0-1) |

## Usage

```yaml
name: Issue Triage
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, edited]

jobs:
  triage:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      issues: write
      contents: read
    steps:
      - uses: qte77/gha-issue-triage@v0.2.4
        with:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## Try it in this repo

This repo dogfoods the action via [`.github/workflows/self-triage.yml`](.github/workflows/self-triage.yml). Every new or edited issue is triaged automatically — no opt-in needed. Side effects: labels may be added, and one sticky summary comment is posted (edited in place on re-runs).

### Sample summary comment

```md
### AI triage summary

- **Duplicate of:** #30 (similarity 0.93)
- **Relevance:** 2/10 — `invalid` — The issue proposes an unrealistic feature unrelated to the repository's scope.
- **Feasibility:** `no` — Faster-than-light travel violates known physics.
```

When `feasibility` is `yes` the comment also shows a `Complexity:` line:

```md
- **Feasibility:** `yes`
- **Complexity:** `medium` — Requires extending the event-handler and adding tests. (~days)
```

The duplicate line is omitted when no duplicate is found.

## Choosing a model

`MODEL` defaults to `openai/gpt-4.1` (GitHub Models). Issue triage is a small/fast model workload — swap to a cheaper or faster model with a one-line caller change. No code change required.

| Use case | Suggested `MODEL` |
| --- | --- |
| Default — strongest general model on free tier | `openai/gpt-4.1` |
| Speed/cost balance | `openai/gpt-4o-mini` |
| Highest throughput | `microsoft/phi-4-mini-instruct` |
| Code-heavy repo (better feasibility scoring) | `deepseek/deepseek-v3-0324` |
| Open-weights preference | `meta/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct` |

See [`docs/integrations.md`](docs/integrations.md) for the full catalog, rationale, and per-model notes.

## OpenAI-compatible backend (Mistral / Cerebras / Ollama / ...)

Set `OPENAI_API_BASE` to point at any OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions endpoint. `AI_TOKEN` is sent as a Bearer token; `MODEL` selects the model. Localhost `http://` is permitted for self-hosted backends; all other URLs must be `https://`.

| Provider | `OPENAI_API_BASE` | Example `MODEL` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mistral (Devstral) | `https://api.mistral.ai/v1` | `devstral-small-2505` |
| Cerebras | `https://api.cerebras.ai/v1` | `llama-3.3-70b` |
| Groq | `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1` | `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` |
| Together | `https://api.together.xyz/v1` | `meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo` |
| Ollama (self-hosted) | `http://localhost:11434/v1` | `devstral-small-2` |
