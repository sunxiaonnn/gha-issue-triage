# Integration Paths

Three non-breaking paths for users of `gha-issue-triage`. GitHub-Models default is preserved in all of them.

- **Path 0** — Stay on GitHub Models, switch to a smaller/faster model via the existing `MODEL` input. **No code change.**
- **Path A** — Use [`apps/claude`](https://github.com/apps/claude) for GitHub auth instead of `github.token`. **No code change.**
- **Path B** — Add OpenAI-compatible backend (Mistral / Devstral / Ollama / vLLM). **One small change in `src/llm.py` + new input.**

## Current Wiring (Reference)

From [`src/llm.py`](../src/llm.py): two backends. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` flips to Anthropic with model **hardcoded** at `claude-sonnet-4-6` (`src/llm.py:51`) — `MODEL` input only affects GitHub Models.

## Path 0 — Different model on GitHub Models

The action's `MODEL` default `openai/gpt-4.1` works but is one of dozens. Issue triage (~5K in / ~500 out, no long context) is a small/fast model task. GitHub Models exposes the same Chat-Completions endpoint for every model, so swapping is a one-line change.

Notable IDs available on GitHub Models ([catalog reference][gh-models-cat]):

| Model ID | Provider | Why for triage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `openai/gpt-4.1` | OpenAI | Current default — strongest general model on free tier |
| `openai/gpt-4o-mini` | OpenAI | ~5× faster than gpt-4.1 at similar triage quality |
| `microsoft/phi-4-mini-instruct` | Microsoft | Tiny, fastest, cheapest — good for high-volume orgs |
| `mistral-ai/mistral-small-3.1` | Mistral | Agentic-leaning, small, fast |
| `meta/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct` | Meta | Open weights, strong reasoning |
| `deepseek/deepseek-v3-0324` | DeepSeek | Strong code understanding for feasibility scoring |

Switching:

```yaml
with:
  MODEL: openai/gpt-4o-mini   # or any ID from the catalog
```

**Recommended free**: `openai/gpt-4o-mini` for speed-cost balance, `microsoft/phi-4-mini-instruct` for highest throughput.
**Recommended for code-heavy repos**: `deepseek/deepseek-v3-0324` (better feasibility analysis than gpt-4o-mini).

GitHub Models has no public per-model pricing — paid tier is "opt into paid usage or BYO API keys" once free-tier rate limits are hit ([GH Models docs][gh-models-docs]).

**Implementation effort: zero** — works today.

## Auth for `AI_TOKEN` (GitHub Models specifically)

The action's `AI_TOKEN` input defaults to `${{ github.token }}`. Combined with `permissions: models: read` on the caller workflow, that is sufficient for the GitHub Models inference endpoint — **no separate PAT or org-level setup is required**. This repo's own [`self-triage.yml`](../.github/workflows/self-triage.yml) demonstrates the pattern.

Three valid token shapes for GitHub Models, in increasing setup cost:

| Token shape | Setup | Models access requirement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `${{ github.token }}` (workflow default) | Add `permissions: models: read` to the caller workflow | Documented as valid syntax under `permissions:` in the [GitHub Actions workflow syntax docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions) |
| Classic PAT | *Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens (classic)* — **no scopes needed** | The REST [Models inference docs](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/models/inference?apiVersion=2022-11-28) note the `models:read` scope is required *only* "when using a fine-grained personal access token or when authenticating using a GitHub App" — classic PATs authenticate as a user without an explicit Models scope |
| Fine-grained PAT | *Settings → Personal access tokens (fine-grained)* — Account permissions → **Models: Read-only** (URL param `&user_models=read`) | Most-locked-down option; required scope is explicit |

### Rate-limit attribution

Per the [Models docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github-models/use-github-models/prototyping-with-ai-models), rate limits are tied to the **Copilot subscription tier** of the user making the call, not the org's plan. Free / Pro / Business share a tier; Copilot Enterprise gets the most headroom.

What "the user making the call" means in each case is **not first-party documented** but coherent with empirical behaviour:

- `${{ github.token }}` → calls run as `github-actions[bot]`, which has no Copilot subscription → lowest free quota bucket. Sufficient for low-volume repos; can 429 on bursts.
- Classic / fine-grained PAT → inherits the **creating user's** Copilot tier. Useful if the maintainer has a higher tier than `github-actions[bot]`.

For low-volume repos, prefer the workflow default — zero secret management. If you hit `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` from the inference endpoint, escalate to a PAT or switch to Path B (an OpenAI-compatible backend with its own quota).

## Path A — Claude GitHub App auth

```yaml
- id: app-token
  uses: actions/create-github-app-token@v1
  with:
    app-id: ${{ secrets.CLAUDE_APP_ID }}
    private-key: ${{ secrets.CLAUDE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}

- uses: qte77/gha-issue-triage@v0.2.4
  with:
    GH_TOKEN: ${{ steps.app-token.outputs.token }}
```

Effect: comments authored by `claude[bot]`, cross-repo scope, refreshable token. Requires `apps/claude` (or custom App with `issues: write`, `contents: read`) installed on the org.

**Implementation effort: zero** — works today via existing `GH_TOKEN` input.

## Path B — OpenAI-compatible backend (Mistral / Cerebras / Ollama / ...)

Shipped in [#11](https://github.com/qte77/gha-issue-triage/issues/11) (action ≥0.2.0). Any OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions endpoint plugs in via the `OPENAI_API_BASE` input — Mistral, Cerebras, Groq, Together, Fireworks, vLLM, Ollama. `AI_TOKEN` is sent as a Bearer; `MODEL` selects the model. Localhost `http://` is allowed for self-hosted; all other URLs must be `https://`.

### Caller workflows

Mistral Devstral (cloud):

```yaml
with:
  AI_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.MISTRAL_API_KEY }}
  MODEL: devstral-small-2505
  OPENAI_API_BASE: https://api.mistral.ai/v1
```

Cerebras (fast inference):

```yaml
with:
  AI_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CEREBRAS_API_KEY }}
  MODEL: llama-3.3-70b
  OPENAI_API_BASE: https://api.cerebras.ai/v1
```

Self-hosted Ollama (RTX 4090 / Mac 32GB):

```yaml
with:
  AI_TOKEN: ollama-no-auth
  MODEL: devstral-small-2
  OPENAI_API_BASE: http://localhost:11434/v1
```

### Cost (10 issues/day, ~5K in / 500 out per issue)

| Backend | Monthly |
| --- | --- |
| GitHub Models (Path 0, any model) | $0 (rate-limited) |
| Anthropic Sonnet | ~$9 |
| Anthropic Opus | ~$34 |
| **Mistral Devstral API** | **~$0.20** |
| Self-hosted Devstral | ~$5–10 power |

## Recommendation Matrix

| Workload | Path | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Low volume, public repo | **Path 0** (any free GH Models ID) | Free, rate limits sufficient |
| Code-heavy repo, want better feasibility scoring | **Path 0 + DeepSeek** | `deepseek-v3-0324` for code understanding |
| Want branded `claude[bot]` author + cross-repo auth | **Path A** | Caller-side only |
| High volume, free tier exhausted | **Path B** (Devstral API) | ~45× cheaper than Sonnet |
| Privacy / compliance | **Path B** (self-hosted) | No API egress |

## Suggested Follow-Ups

1. Optionally make the Anthropic model `MODEL`-driven when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set (Sonnet 4.6 is the current hardcoded default)
