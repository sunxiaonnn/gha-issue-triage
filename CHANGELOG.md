## [Unreleased]

---

## [0.2.4] - 2026-05-17

### Fixed

- README and `docs/integrations.md` usage examples pinned to a real release tag (`@v0.2.4`); previously pointed at `@v0` and `@v1` respectively, neither of which exists — copy-pasted examples failed with `tag not found` (#TBD)

### Documentation

- Backfilled empty `[0.2.2]` and `[0.2.3]` sections in `CHANGELOG.md` with the actual changes that shipped under those tags (#TBD)

---

## [0.2.3] - 2026-05-17

### Fixed

- SHA-pin `actions/checkout@v6` → `actions/checkout@de0fac2e4500dabe0009e67214ff5f5447ce83dd` (v6.0.2) in `action.yaml`. Unblocks consumers in strict-pin-policy organizations that reject tag refs on every nested `uses:`, including inside composite actions (#54)

---

## [0.2.2] - 2026-05-15

### Fixed

- `action.yaml` `description` trimmed from 141 → 119 chars to pass GitHub Marketplace publication validation (≤124 chars). No behaviour change (#52)

---

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-14

### Added

- Theme-aware screenshot of triaged issues in the README, collapsed under a `<details>` block (#46)
- `docs/integrations.md`: "Auth for `AI_TOKEN`" section documenting the three valid token shapes for GitHub Models (workflow `${{ github.token }}` with `permissions: models: read`, scopeless classic PAT, fine-grained PAT with `user_models:read`) plus rate-limit attribution caveats (#47)

### Changed

- Self-triage workflow uses the default `${{ github.token }}` for GitHub Models calls instead of a custom `GH_MODELS` PAT — `permissions: models: read` is sufficient. Callers no longer need to mint a PAT for the default Path 0 setup (#47)
- `.markdownlint.json` added at the repo root: disables MD013 (line-length), allows duplicate `### Added` / `### Fixed` headings under different version H2s, permits inline `<details>` / `<summary>` / `<picture>` / `<source>` / `<img>` for theme-aware images. Table separator rows in README and `docs/integrations.md` reformatted from `|---|---|` to `| --- | --- |` (#43, #46)

### Fixed

- Category label (`feature` / `bug` / `enhancement` / `needs-discussion`) is no longer applied when `relevance.irrelevant=true`; only `invalid` (plus feasibility/duplicate labels) is applied. Resolves the contradictory `invalid` + `feature` combo that appeared on out-of-scope issues (#41)
- `apply_labels` now reconciles the managed label set on every triage run: fossil labels within `VALID_LABELS` are removed, additions and removals happen in a single `gh issue edit` call, and a no-op fast-path skips the call entirely when the set is already in sync. Human-applied labels outside `VALID_LABELS` are preserved (#42)

---

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- `OPENAI_API_BASE` input — third LLM backend for any OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions endpoint (Mistral / Devstral, Ollama, vLLM, self-hosted). Takes precedence over Anthropic and GitHub Models when set. Localhost `http://` allowed for self-hosted; all other URLs must be `https://` (#11)
- Sticky AI summary comment per issue, idempotent across re-runs via a hidden marker (#28, #29)
- Self-triage workflow: every new/edited issue in this repo is triaged automatically (#24, #32)
- New `feasibility` (yes/no) field in the analysis output, distinct from `complexity` (low/medium/high). Renders as its own line in the summary comment; `Complexity:` is omitted when `feasibility=no`.
- README sections for Path 0 (model alternatives) and Path A (Claude GitHub App auth), plus a sample summary comment (#22, #23, #33)
- `docs/integrations.md`: integration paths overview (Path 0/A/B) with cost matrix (#9)

### Changed

- Anthropic model bumped to `claude-sonnet-4-6` (#17)
- Rendered analysis line: `Feasibility:` → `Complexity:` to match the underlying field's semantics (high = hard) (#31)
- `astral-sh/setup-uv` pinned to v8.1.0 SHA — clears the Node-20 deprecation warning and `url.parse` DEP0169 (#25, #26)
- README license references updated MIT → Apache-2.0 to match `LICENSE` (#31)
- `app.py` now accepts `issues: labeled` events for label-gated callers (#25)

### Fixed

- `find_duplicates` excludes the current issue from the candidate pool — no more spurious self-match `duplicate` label (#27)
- Summary comment renders balanced parens regardless of `estimated_effort` value (#29)
- `_request_with_retry` validates `https://` scheme before `urllib.urlopen` (Bandit B310) (#15)
- `parser` typed as `Callable[[dict], str]` instead of the builtin `callable` (#31)
- `uv.lock` synced to project version 0.1.1 (#16)

---

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-08

### Added

- Initial release: AI-powered issue triage GitHub Action
- Duplicate detection via difflib fuzzy matching
- Relevance scoring via LLM (GitHub Models API or Anthropic)
- Feasibility analysis with codebase context
- Auto-labeling via gh CLI
